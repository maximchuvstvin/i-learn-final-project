# i-learn-final-project

### Project Summary

TripleTen World Consultancy (TTWC) provided a short snapshot of a SQLite database for AtliQ Hardware's sales data, which was used as the final project for an online course in data analysis. Python was the main tool used for the project, along with SQL queries for data manipulation wherever possible. The project also involved preparing a Tableau dashboard and testing hypotheses to drive data-driven decisions and operational efficiency.

**Tableau Dashboard:** The Tableau dashboard for this project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/atliq_sales/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
